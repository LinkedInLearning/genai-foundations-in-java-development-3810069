Harness the power of ChatGPT to supercharge your Java coding skills with the finesse of a master coder. In this course, mathematician and software developer Terezija Semenski shows you how to bring the finesse of a master coder to your generative AI endeavors. Get a step-by-step guide on using ChatGPT for Java development. Find out how to accelerate your coding journey with ChatGPT and go over the benefits and limitations of using AI. Learn how to write your first app, troubleshoot it, and use it in IntelliJ IDE. Go beyond basic coding and explore ways to use AI to follow clean code principles, craft test cases, and generate UML and sequence diagrams. Plus, get ready for your next interview as you incorporate ChatGPT into mock interviews and writing a compelling resume. This course is packed with example prompts that you can copy, paste, and use to easily follow along.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
